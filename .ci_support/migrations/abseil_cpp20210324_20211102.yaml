# hmaarrfk (2022/05/06)
# Due to the fact that cetain large packages (tensorflow)
# require specific versions of abseil to be used, it is
# useful if we build out two versions with the abseil dependency
abseil_cpp:
- '20210324.2'
- '20211102.0'

# However, grpc_cpp 1.46 now requires the newer version, so for the
# abseil version 20210324 we need to ensure to build with the lastest
# version of grpc that still supports it.
grpc_cpp:
- 1.45
